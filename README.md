# Airspace Data Analyst Screening

## Objective
The purpose of this exercise is to gain an understanding of how you approach and tackle a rather vague task. The intent is to enable you to showcase both your technical capabilities as well as your ability to explore unfamilar data and generate useful insights based on what you find. 

The `order_records` file in this repository contains information from a sampling of Airspace orders. The fields in the data set are:
- order_id: unique identifier of an order
- company_id: unique identifier of the company who placed the order
- service_line: categorical indicator of the "type" of order
- driver_type: either 'commander' which is an independant contractor who drives for Airspace (our version of Uber drivers), or 'agent' which is a 3rd party professional courier
- weight_lbs: total weight of the order
- volume_in3: total volume of the order
- expense: amount paid to the driver who completed the order
- pickup/delivery_zip: starting and ending zip codes of the order

## Outcomes
The outcome of this project is very open ended. I want you to explore the data, develop any interesting or useful insights, and present your findings in a compelling way. The methods you use are really up to you. The final deliverable could be a data vizualization or dashboard, a notebook containing your EDA, a simple machine learning model, etc.
